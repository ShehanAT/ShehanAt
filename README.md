### Hi there, I'm Sean Atukorala

I am a QA Analyst by profession, Freelance Software Developer and most importantly, problem solver. I believe in two foundational pillars as a good problem solver: great communication skills and tons of in-the-trenches experience. I have worked with many different clients and I'm sure I can provide value to you too, so feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:shehanatuk@gmail.com) or from any of my social links listed below:
